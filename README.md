# Shilling attacks and detection methods
## Usage

This repository houses the code to generate and detect attack profiles using ```generate_attack_files.py```,```supervised_detection_methods[baseline].py```,```ud_hmm.py``` 
## Shilling attacks 
For generating attack profiles please refer to ```generate_attack_files.py```
- Random Attack
- Average Attack
- Bandwagon Attack

## Detection of shilling attacks

### Supervised Approaches
The implementations for the following can be referred using ```supervised_detection_methods[baseline].py```
- SVM
- kNN
- MLP
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes (Gaussian)

### Unsupervised Approaches
The implementations for the following can be referred using ```ud_hmm.py```
- UD-HMM
